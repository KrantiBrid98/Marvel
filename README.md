## Objective:
- To implement basic concepts of react like React-router, refs, React portals, middleware, fetching data through API and populating the fetched data through Route Links
- Google oAuth has been used for authentication.
- Backend has been added to store user-comments.
- NestJS which is a Node.js framework, has been used to set up the server.
- MySQL is used as database for storing the user comments.

<p> comments cannot be added for now using the above hoisted link. You can however take a look at the comment functionality by locally running the app on your system</p>
